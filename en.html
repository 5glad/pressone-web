						If Bitcoin is the first successful blockchain application that
						revolutionizes the business model of banks in a decentralized way,
						then PressOne is to revolutionize the business model of press
						where the way any single content provider does business is radically changed.
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						PressOne will possibly become the biggest public chain on the Internet.

						Since the Internet comprises of contents, such as texts, image, sound or videos,
						revolutionizing existing distributing channels may well mean to "reconstruct the whole Internet".

						PressOne will quite possibly become the most natural and profuse public chain of DAPP.
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						Content-creation business consists of three parts: production, discovery and distribution.

						Production must be provided by outstanding individuals or team,
						thus does not have to be decentralized.

						Discovery and distribution, however, are where a decentralized network gains an edge...
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						The goal of the revolution of content providers is to ease them from the restrictions of centralized organizations.
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						When a piece of work is finished, the market will take care of everything.
						Releasing a new work means publishing a new "asset" (the securitization of content),
						and its value will be proved by the market.

						In this way, producer, discoverer and distributer's role may overlap, but any of them could seek profit.

					<textarea data-template>
						Using a real-name system is not nearly scary as some people have imagined.
						On the contrary, it may encourage people to make reliable comments…

						If anyone intend to hide his/her identity, no worries —
						there are countless ways and places on the Internet that one can appear anonymous.
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						Censorship is also not terrifying.
						A censorship with consensus mechanisms may also enhance the quality of contents.

						Censorship does not constrain freedom for a similar reason: if one hates censorship,
						plenty of ways and places are available on the Internet.

						PressOne is not merely a Chinese project.
						The mechanisms it provides are the same for people of any nationality, race, gender, language, etc.
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						Nor is PressOne a competitor of Steem. In fact, we are collaborators — complimentary to meet different needs.
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						Traditional "whitepapers" will not be provided before the official launch of PressOne
						(truth is, rarely do people read or understand whitepapers).

						When PressOne will be officially released, ever-perfecting documentations
						will be provided to support succeeding developers.
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						Based on PressOne, developers and operators can easily build various content circles,
						social media, etc. …

						This will not be just a game for tech geeks,
						but an invaluable opportunity for all content providers to ride on the latest trend.

						They don't need to know technology or blockchain —
						just like anybody can use cash without profound financial knowledge.
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						PressOne can be imagined as a giant incubator.
						We will organize "campaigns" for entities that intend to grow vertically,
						and circle members will select the best candidates or teams possible to "go on the expedition".
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						PressOne is not a company — in the blockchain world, a company entity is not theoretically necessary.

						The ideal objective of a successful blockchain project is to build a decentralized self-autonomous
						enterprise/organization.

						All of the rules should be written in the smart contract, rather than enforced by management.
						Only in this way can it be sustainable and scalable.
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						Why us?

						First, we are based in China, a country with world's most Internet users.
						Second, Chinese developers are global leaders in user experience.
						Our dev team come from all over the world,
						and their work experience in the blockchain world adds up to more than a hundred years.
					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						We also have massive resources: imagine Yikuaitingting built on PressOne,
						Knewone.com built on PressOne…

						People often say I'am the person with the greatest brainpower they've ever known, and it is no exaggeration.
